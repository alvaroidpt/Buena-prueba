## AdminBro

Admin Bro is an Admin Framework for Node - your best Bro in app developement.

Currently it supports only MongoDB (via mongoose).

## How it works

It is totally separated from any particular nodejs framework. Because of that it can be easily integrated to almost every app.


### Overal architecture

<div class="mermaid">
  graph LR
  subgraph AdminBro
  B(AdminBro)
  end
  subgraph Resources
  A[mongoose] --> B
  C[rest API endpoints] --> B
  D[sequelizejs] --> B
  end
  subgraph http framework
  B --> E[Hapijs]
  B --> F[Express.js]
  B --> G[your custom framework]
  end

</div>

### This is an example rendering flow for hapi.js

<div class="mermaid">
  graph LR
  A[<a href=./examples_hapijs_index.js.html>Hapi.js</a>] -->|<a href=./admin_integrations_hapi.js.html>Mapping Routes</a>| B
  subgraph AdminBro
  B{<a href=./Router.html>Router.js</a>}
  B --> C(DashoardController)
  B --> D(ResourcesController)
  E(Renderer)
  C --> E
  D --> E
  F(PUG view)
  E --> F
  end
</div>

## Integration with nodejs Frameworks

Example integration for Hapi.js framework can be found [here]{@link examples/hapijs/index.js}. This code uses Hapi.js [integration plugin]{@link admin/integrations/hapi.js}. If you want to write your own implementation you will have to:

- write a plugin/middleware for a particular framework
- map its routing system to AdminBro routes and controllers (see how Hapi does that: {@link admin/integrations/hapi.js})
- checkout if given framework has ORM already supported. If not you will have to create data mapper for it (see below)
- lastly - don't forget to add integration example in examples folder

## Data model

Most important part of the system is its data model. AdminBro can be integrated with multiple ORMs, that is why it has internal abstraction for handling multiple data models.

This is how it looks:

<div class="mermaid">
  graph TD
  A[<a href=./BaseDatabase.html>BaseDatabase</a>] -->|has many| B(<a href=./BaseResource.html>BaseResource</a>)
  B --> |has many|C(<a href=./BaseRecord.html>BaseRecord</a>)
  B --> |has many|D(<a href=./BaseProperty.html>BaseProperty</a>)
</div>

First of all [base class]{@link AdminBro} is used to convert all supported database connections (mongodb, sql-like, etc) to list of databases which interits from {@link BaseDatabase}. It utilises {@link DatabaseFactory} to construct correct database type.

Then each class which inherits {@link BaseDatabase} can fetch all resources present in the database. Each resource inherits from {@link BaseResource}

Each model has multiple [properties]{@link BasePorperty} with different types like String, Data, Number etc.

Finally particular database record/document is mapped to {@link BaseRecord}

## Integration with ORMs

To create new ORM integration you have to:

- create your implementation of {@link BaseDatabase}, {@link BaseResource}, {@link BaseRecord} and {@link AbstractProperty}
- update {@link DatabaseFactory}
- update examples
- most probably you will also have to update docker-compose to handle new database
